## Call interface

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [addEventListener(callEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_methodsignature.md) | Generic event listener typings. |
|  [addEventListener(connectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_1_methodsignature.md) | Connected event. Raised when the call has successfully connected. |
|  [addEventListener(connectFailureEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_2_methodsignature.md) | Connect failure event. Raised when the call has failed to connect. |
|  [addEventListener(reconnectingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_3_methodsignature.md) | Reconnecting event. Raised when the call is reconnecting. |
|  [addEventListener(reconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_4_methodsignature.md) | Reconnected event. Raised when the call has recovered and reconnected. |
|  [addEventListener(disconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_5_methodsignature.md) | Disconnected event. Raised when the call has disconnected. |
|  [addEventListener(ringingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_6_methodsignature.md) | Ringing event. Raised when the call has begun to ring. |
|  [addEventListener(qualityWarningsChangedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addeventlistener_7_methodsignature.md) | Quality warnings changed event. Raised when a call quality warning is set or unset. All "ongoing" call quality warnings are passed to the invoked listener function. |

|  [on(connectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_1_methodsignature.md) | Connected event. Raised when the call has successfully connected. |
|  [on(connectFailureEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_2_methodsignature.md) | Connect failure event. Raised when the call has failed to connect. |
|  [on(reconnectingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_3_methodsignature.md) | Reconnecting event. Raised when the call is reconnecting. |
|  [on(reconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_4_methodsignature.md) | Reconnected event. Raised when the call has recovered and reconnected. |
|  [on(disconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_5_methodsignature.md) | Disconnected event. Raised when the call has disconnected. |
|  [on(ringingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_6_methodsignature.md) | Ringing event. Raised when the call has begun to ring. |
|  [on(qualityWarningsChangedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_7_methodsignature.md) | Quality warnings changed event. Raised when a call quality warning is set or unset. All "ongoing" call quality warnings are passed to the invoked listener function. |
